# Power-BI-Spotify-Dashboard-

# INTRODUCTION
This project presents a dynamic and interactive dashboard developed in PowerBI, showcasing an analysis of the top Spotify songs from 2018 to 2023. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from kaggle, the dashboard provides insights into trends in music preferences, artist popularity, and song characteristics over the years. The aim is to offer users a detailed overview of the evolving music landscape, highlighting key metrics such as energy levels, average stream counts per year, and top artists. This tool is designed for music enthusiasts, industry analysts, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of popular music through data visualization.

# Dataset Source
The analysis is based on the dataset available at Kaggle: Top Spotify Songs 2023. This dataset encompasses a wide range of information, including:

Track Information
Music Statistics

# Advanced Visualization and Tools
DENEB Visuals
The dashboard incorporates DENEB visuals, a powerful tool for creating custom visualizations within PowerBI. Here's how DENEB has been used to enhance the dashboard's analytical capabilities:

Energy Gauge: Custom-built to display the energy level of songs, providing an intuitive visual representation of song intensity.
Heatmap with Bars: Combines the heatmap and bar chart to offer a detailed comparison of various metrics across different categories, such as artist popularity or song features over time.
Customizing with Vega/Vega-Lite: Access the Deneb visual's properties and insert your Vega or Vega-Lite JSON specification into the editor. You can design your gauge or heatmap based on the dataset fields available in your PowerBI model.
Interactivity: Leverage Vega's signal and event handlers to add interactivity to your visuals, such as tooltips, zooming, or filtering based on user interaction.
These visuals were crafted using the Vega-Lite visualization grammar, allowing for a high degree of customization and interactivity not available with standard PowerBI visuals.

# HTML Content
To further enrich the dashboard, HTML content has been embedded to display dynamic images and links, offering a more engaging user experience. This approach allows for the integration of album covers and artist images directly within the dashboard, making the data exploration process both informative and visually appealing.
